        <h2>Personal Life</h2>
        <p>Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Her genre-spanning discography, songwriting and artistic reinventions have received critical praise and wide media coverage. Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville at age 14 to become a country artist. She signed a songwriting deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2004 and a recording contract with Big Machine Records in 2005. Her 2006 self-titled debut album made her the first female country singer to write a U.S. platinum-certified album. 
            Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989,[1] in West Reading, Pennsylvania.[2] Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, is a former stockbroker for Merrill Lynch[3] and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), is a former homemaker who previously worked as a mutual fund marketing executive.[4] Her younger brother, Austin, is an actor.[5] She was named after singer-songwriter James Taylor,[6] and has Scottish[7] and German heritage. Her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, was an opera singer.[8] Swift spent her early years on a Christmas tree farm that her father had purchased from one of his clients.[9][10] Swift identifies as a Christian.[11] She attended preschool and kindergarten at the Alvernia Montessori School, run by the Bernadine Franciscan sisters,[12] before transferring to The Wyndcroft School.[13] The family moved to a rented house in the suburban town of Wyomissing, Pennsylvania,[14] where Swift attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.[15] She spent her summers at the beach in Stone Harbor, New Jersey, and performed in a local coffee shop.[16][17]
            At age nine, Swift became interested in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions.[18] She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons.[19] Swift later shifted her focus toward country music, inspired by Shania Twain's songs, which made her "want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything."[20] She spent weekends performing at local festivals and events.[21][22] After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt sure she needed to move to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a career in music.[23] She traveled with her mother at age eleven to visit Nashville record labels and submitted demo tapes of Dolly Parton and The Chicks karaoke covers.[24] She was rejected, however, because "everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I need to figure out a way to be different."[25]
            When Swift was around 12 years old, computer repairman and local musician Ronnie Cremer taught her to play guitar. "Kiss Me" by Sixpence None the Richer was the first song Swift learned to play on the guitar. Cremer helped with her first efforts as a songwriter, leading her to write "Lucky You".[26][27] In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with New York-based talent manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch as part of their "Rising Stars" campaign, had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD, and attended meetings with major record labels.[28] After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, Swift, then 13 years old, was given an artist development deal and began making frequent trips to Nashville with her mother.[29][30][31] To help Swift enter into the country music scene, her father transferred to Merrill Lynch's Nashville office when she was 14 years old, and the family relocated to Hendersonville, Tennessee.[9][32] Swift initially attended Hendersonville High School[33] before transferring to the Aaron Academy after two years, which better suited her touring schedule through homeschooling. She graduated one year early.[34]

        <p>American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift has written or co-written every song in her discography, with the exception of several cover versions and two guest features, alongside some songs released by other artists. Swift signed with Sony/ATV Tree publishing house in 2004 to become a professional songwriter.[1] Pursuing a country music career in Nashville, she wrote or co-wrote all 11 tracks on her eponymous debut album, which was released by Big Machine Records in 2006.[2][3] In 2007, Swift released her first extended play (EP), The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection, which includes four cover versions of Christmas classics and two self-written songs. Beautiful Eyes (2008), Swift's second EP, features alternate versions of songs from her debut album and two new tracks.[4]

            On her second studio album, Fearless (2008), Swift wrote eight tracks by herself and co-wrote the remaining five with Liz Rose—who had worked with her on her debut album—among others.[5][6] She wrote all 14 tracks of her third studio album, Speak Now (2010), by herself; the album explores many mainstream pop and rock styles in addition to the country pop sound of its predecessor.[7] On her next release, Red (2012), Swift experimented with many other pop, rock, electronic, and hip hop styles.[8] She wrote nine Red tracks by herself and co-wrote with others including Swedish producers Max Martin and Shellback. Martin and Shellback collaborated with her again on her next two studio albums, 1989 (2014) and Reputation (2017), on which Swift also worked with producer Jack Antonoff and recalibrated her musical identity from country to pop.[9] Antonoff continued collaborating with Swift on her seventh studio album, Lover (2019), which marks her first release after leaving Big Machine for Republic Records; Lover includes three solely-written tracks.[10]
            
            On her 2020 alternative rock and indie folk studio albums, Folklore and Evermore, in addition to Antonoff, Aaron Dessner of the National became a key producer and co-writer.[11] Swift's partner Joe Alwyn was co-writer and co-producer of select tracks. From April 2021, Swift has released two re-recorded albums—Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version)—to claim ownership of the masters of her Big Machine-released albums.[12] Each of the re-recorded albums includes "from the Vault" unreleased songs Swift had written but excluded from the original releases' track lists. One such song, "All Too Well (10 Minute Version)", is the unabridged version of the previously-released "All Too Well". Swift's tenth original studio album, Midnights (2022), features Antonoff as the main collaborator and Dessner as the co-writer and co-producer for select bonus tracks.[13]
            
            In addition to solo material, Swift has recorded two songs as featured artist without a writing credit: "Highway Don't Care" (Tim McGraw, 2013) and "Birch" (Big Red Machine, 2021). She has written songs for film soundtracks including Valentine's Day (2010), The Hunger Games (2012), Fifty Shades Darker (2017), Cats (2019), and Where the Crawdads Sing (2022). Some tracks written by Swift were released as standalone singles for her other projects, such as the Christmas single "Christmas Tree Farm" (2019) and the track "Only the Young" (2020) for her documentary Miss Americana. Among tracks she wrote for other artists are "Best Days of Your Life" (Kellie Pickler), "This Is What You Came For" (Calvin Harris featuring Rihanna), and "Better Man" (Little Big Town). </p>
